		<h3>1. Review The Brief</h3>

		<p>When starting a design challenge, you really want to make sure set off on the right path. You’re going to feel a right fool if you turn up with a presentation on a complex private messaging app for Android because your modern brain with its short attention span can’t concentrate reading a 2 page brief. Grab a cup of tea, turn your phone off, and make some notes. You’ll be thankful for it later.</p>

			<h3>2. Understand The Competition</h3>

			<p>You’re going to want to know what you’re up against. How have others tackled similar problems? Download a few apps and spend some time exploring them. Enjoy the fact that you can do this from your sofa.</p>

		<div class="inner">
			<h3>3. Listen To The People</h3>

			<p>Remember, you’re designing for people, so try and find out what they need. If you don’t have time to meet them face to face, explore the online communities. Review sections can be a great source of people’s current frustrations with an experience.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>4. Fail Fast</h3>

			<p>Short projects can be a fun time to explore new processes, like scraping the App Store review data using a Python script. Entering into new territory like this can also just be time wasted. It’s important to quickly identify when to pivot, and try alternative techniques, like just taking lots of screenshots and reading through them later.</p>

			<h3>5. Explore The Customer Journey</h3>

			<p>Now you’ve got a better understanding of the product and customer pain-points, piece it all together.</p>

			<h3>6. Think About The Business</h3>

			<p>You probably don’t have a strategy team on your side, or even any real stakeholders to talk to, but why not have a first stab at the Business Model Canvas. After all, someone’s got to think about the value of this product before it gets put into production!</p>

			<h3>7. Design In Context</h3>

			<p>It’s important not to design in isolation. Just because you only have to show a particular screen, make sure you consider it’s place within the wider experience. Rough sketches are fine, but you want to clean it up in Sketch for the final presentation. Not everyone can understand your scribbles or handwriting.</p>

			<h3>8. Content First.</h3>

			<p>Before you start drawing pretty shapes, think about what you’re actually attempting to communicate. What are the most important messages or pieces of information? Is there a hierarchy? Now you’ve figured that out, test out ways to organise it visually.</p>

			<h3>9. Piece By Piece.</h3>

			<p>Think about both the macro and the micro in bursts. What might a component look like? How does a page accomodate components. When you’re happy with each element, piece it all together into a single wireframe.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<div class="inner">
			<h3>10. Style It Out.</h3>

			<p>Once you’re happy with the layout,  give it some personality. Defining a whole brand could be an entire project in itself, but you could at least select a suitable colour palette and add some fun through illustration.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

		<div class="pallette-1"></div>

		<div class="img-note">
			<p class="">A colour palette you can trust</p>
		</div>

			<h3>11. Make It Move.</h3>

			<p>The human eye is attracted to motion, so for the final flourish, take your designs and drop them into Principle to visualise a short flow.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

			<h3>12. Prepare The Presentation</h3>

			<p>A good designer knows that they way an idea is presented can be as important as the idea itself. Use this as an opportunity to showcase any other talents that the challenge didn’t cover, like storytelling, front-end development or Git.
			</br> Then breathe a sigh of relief. Your work here is done. For now...</p>
