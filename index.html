			<h3>1.</br>Review The Brief</h3>
		

			<p>This part is pretty crucial, so you're going to want to concentrate. You can't <i>design the thing right</i> if you aren't <i>designing the right thing</i>. Remember, technology has rendered most people's attention spans down to zero, so try and prove you're one step ahead in this respect. Grab a cup of tea, turn your phone off, read it thoroughly and maybe even make some notes. You won't regret it.

			<h3>2.</br>Understand The Competition</h3>

			<p>Know Thy Enemy. How have others tackled similar problems? Download a few apps and spend some time exploring them. Enjoy doing this from the comfort of your sofa.</p>

			<h3>3.</br>Listen To The People</h3>

			<p>Remember: you’re designing for human beings. Try and find out their needs. If you don’t have time to meet them face to face, explore the online communities. Review sections can be a great resource for people’s current frustrations with an experience.</p>

			<h3>4.</br>Fail Fast</h3>

			<p>Short projects can be a fun time to explore new processes. Want to scrape the App Store review data? Why not see if there's a Python script for that? But beware, entering into new territory can also be a waste of time. It’s important to quickly identify when to pivot. Sometimes a bit of manual labour, like taking lots of screenshots, will do the trick.</p>

			<h3>6.</br>Think About The Business</h3>

			<p>You probably don’t have a strategy team on your side, or even any real stakeholders to talk to, but why not have a first stab at the Business Model Canvas? After all, someone’s got to think about the value of this product before it gets put into production!</p>

			<h3>7.</br>Design In Context</h3>

			<p>Don't design in isolation. Just because you only have to show one screen, you should still consider its place within the wider experience. Rough sketches are fine initially, but you'll want to clean it up in Sketch for the final presentation. Not everyone can understand your scribbles or handwriting. Did I say not everyone? I meant nobody.</p>

			<h3>8.</br>Content First</h3>

			<p>Before you begin drawing a mysterious collection of carefully organised rectangles, think about what you’re actually attempting to communicate. What are the most important messages or pieces of information? Is there a hierarchy? Now you’ve figured that out, test out ways to organise it visually. Iteration is your friend here.</p>

			<h3>9.</br>Piece By Piece</h3>

			<p>Think about both the macro and micro in bursts. What might a component look like? How does a page accomodate components? How do compontents work together? When you’re happy with the individual elements, piece it all together into a single wireframe.</p>

			<h3>10.</br>Style It Out</h3>

			<p>Happy with your layout? Great. Time to give it some personality. Defining a whole brand could be an entire project in itself, but for now you could select a suitable colour palette and add some fun through illustration.</p>

			<h3>11.</br>A GIF For Good Measure</h3>

			<p>The human eye is attracted to motion, so for the final flourish, take your designs and drop them into Principle to visualise a short interaction flow.</p>

			<h3>12.</br>Prepare The Presentation</h3>

			<p>A good designer knows that the presentation of an idea is as vital as the idea itself. Use this as an opportunity to showcase any other talents that the challenge itself didn’t cover, like storytelling, front-end development or Git. Then breathe a sigh of relief. Your work here is done. For now...</p>
