		<h3>1. Review The Brief</h3>

		<p>When starting a design challenge, make sure set off on the right path. You’re going to feel regret turning up with a presentation for a complex private messaging Android app because your modern brain, with its short attention span, can’t finish reading a 2 page brief. Grab a cup of tea, turn your phone off, and make some notes. You’ll be thankful later.</p>

			<h3>2. Understand The Competition</h3>

			<p>Know Thy Enemy. How have others tackled similar problems? Download a few apps and spend some time exploring them. Enjoy doing this from the comfort of your sofa.</p>

	<div class="section">
		<div class="inner">
			<h3>3. Listen To The People</h3>

			<p>Remember: you’re designing for people. Try and find out their needs. If you don’t have time to meet them face to face, explore the online communities. Review sections can be a great resource for people’s current frustrations with an experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="inner">
			<h3>4. Fail Fast</h3>

			<p>Short projects can be a fun time to explore new processes. Want to try scraping the App Store review data? Why not see if there's a Python script for that? But beware, entering into new territory can also be a waste of time. It’s important to quickly identify when to pivot. Sometimes a bit of manual labour, like taking lots of screenshots, will do the trick.</p>

			<h3>5. Explore The Customer Journey</h3>

			<p>Now you have a better understanding of the product requirements and customer pain-points, piece it all together.</p>

		<div class="inner">
			<h3>6. Think About The Business</h3>

			<p>You probably don’t have a strategy team on your side, or even any real stakeholders to talk to, but why not have a first stab at the Business Model Canvas? After all, someone’s got to think about the value of this product before it gets put into production!</p>

		<div class="inner">
			<h3>7. Design In Context</h3>

			<p>Don't design in isolation. Just because you only have to show a particular screen, make sure you consider it’s place within the wider experience. Rough sketches are fine initially, but you'll want to clean it up in Sketch for the final presentation. Not everyone can understand your scribbles or handwriting.</p>

			<h3>8. Content First.</h3>

			<p>Before you start drawing a mysterious collection of neatly organised rectangles, think about what you’re actually attempting to communicate. What are the most important messages or pieces of information? Is there a hierarchy? Now you’ve figured that out, test out ways to organise it visually. Iteration is your friend here.</p>

			<h3>9. Piece By Piece.</h3>

			<p>Think about both the macro and micro in bursts. What might a component look like? How does a page accomodate components. When you’re happy with each element, piece it all together into a single wireframe.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

		<div class="inner">
			<h3>10. Style It Out.</h3>

			<p>Happy with your layout? Great! Time to give it some personality. Defining a whole brand could be an entire project in itself, but for now you could select a suitable colour palette and add some fun through illustration.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="img-wrap">
		<div class="pallette-1"></div>

			<p class="">A colour palette you can trust</p>

			<h3>11. A GIF For Good Measure.</h3>

			<p>The human eye is attracted to motion, so for the final flourish, take your designs and drop them into Principle to visualise a short interaction flow.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="img-wrap wrap-mini">

	<div class="section">
		<div class="inner">
			<h3>12. Prepare The Presentation</h3>

			<p>A good designer knows that the presentation of an idea is as vital as the idea itself. Use this as an opportunity to showcase any other talents that the challenge itself didn’t cover, like storytelling, front-end development or Git. Then breathe a sigh of relief. Your work here is done. For now...</p>
